		<p>Are you craving for some sweetness, but also want to stay healthy? Congradulations! Red Velvet Smoothie can be your choice! Put banana, beets, cocoa powder, and dates all together in the blender for 5 minutes, and boom, it's ready to be served! 
		
		<p>Red-Velvet smoothie is inspired by red velvet cake and the k-pop group Red Velvet! Red velvet cake is a Southern dish that originated in the 1800s; while the red velvet girls group was debuted on 2014 =) </p>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>If using raw beets, chop, measure out, and set aside. If cooking, see notes. Add all ingredients to a high-speed blender and blend until creamy and smooth, adding more dairy-free milk as needed to help blend.</li>
			<li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more dates for sweetness, beets for earthier flavor / more intense magenta color, or cocoa / cacao powder for richer chocolate flavor.</li>
			<li>Serve immediately. Enjoy as is or top with red velvet cake balls, cocoa / cacao powder, beetroot powder, or coconut whipped cream (all optional). Best when fresh. Will keep in the freezer up to 2 weeks (thaw before enjoying).</li>
		</ol>
